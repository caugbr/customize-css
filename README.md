# Customize CSS

**Customize CSS**  is an advanced and highly customizable plugin designed to empower specific users to edit layout details in predefined areas of your site, directly from the frontend. Unlike traditional customization tools,  **Customize CSS**  applies changes dynamically, without modifying any server-side files or the original content. This makes it ideal for environments where multiple users need to personalize their sections of a site, such as internal "newspapers" or category-based layouts in educational institutions.

### Key Features:

-   **Frontend-Only Customization**:  
    All changes are applied "on top" of the loaded page using dynamically injected  **CSS**  and  **JavaScript**, ensuring that the original content remains untouched and secure.
    
-   **Granular Control with Customization Rules**:  
    Create detailed rules to define:
    
    -   **What can be edited**: Specify editable elements using CSS selectors (e.g., headings, backgrounds, images).
    -   **Where changes apply**:
        -   For taxonomies (like categories), choose whether edits apply to  **single posts**  and/or  **post lists**.
        -   For pages, define if  **subpages inherit**  editing permissions.
    -   **Who can edit**: Set permissions by user roles, custom fields, or specific users.
        
-   **Interactive Editing Interface**:
    
    -   When entering "edit mode," editable elements are highlighted for easy identification.
    -   Clicking on an element opens a popup with all allowed CSS properties for that element.
    -   For images, the WordPress media library opens directly in the frontend, allowing users to choose a replacement image from the existing media library.
        
-   **Secure Image Management**:
    
    -   Users can only select images that already exist in the media library.
    -   Uploading new images or deleting existing ones is restricted to maintain security and control.
        
-   **User-Friendly and Safe**:
    
    -   Designed for users with basic technical knowledge, but no manual coding is required.
    -   Restrict access to the admin panel, ensuring users can only edit what they are allowed to.

### Ideal Use Cases:

**Customize CSS**  was developed to meet the needs of collaborative environments where multiple groups or teams need to personalize their sections of a shared website. For example, imagine a  **corporate intranet**  where different departments (e.g., Marketing, HR, IT) have their own dedicated sections. With this plugin, each department can:

-   Customize the layout of their section without affecting others.
-   Edit specific elements (like colors, fonts, or images) directly from the frontend.
-   Work within a secure and controlled environment, with no risk of altering the site’s core content.

### Some other examples

#### Online Magazine

Imagine an  **online magazine**  with multiple contributors, each responsible for their own column or category (e.g., Technology, Lifestyle, Health). With  **Customize CSS**, contributors can:

-   Personalize the visual style of their column to match their brand or theme.
-   Edit specific elements (like headings, background colors, or images) without needing access to the admin panel.
-   Ensure that their changes don’t interfere with other contributors’ sections.
    
#### Multi-Author Blog

For a  **multi-author blog**, where each author manages their own posts or categories,  **Customize CSS**  allows:

-   Authors to customize the appearance of their posts or category pages.
-   Editors to define specific rules for what can be edited (e.g., only colors and fonts) and by whom.
-   A seamless editing experience directly on the frontend, without risking the site’s overall design.

Ideal for sites that allow collaboration among multiple users but need to maintain strict control over what each user can change. With **Customize CSS**, you offer customization freedom without compromising security or the integrity of your site's layout.
