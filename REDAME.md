# Customize CSS  
**Customize CSS** is an advanced and highly customizable plugin that allows you to grant specific users the ability to edit layout details in predefined areas of your site, directly from the frontend. With a robust rule system, you can control exactly what, where, and who can make changes, ensuring both flexibility and security. All changes are applied directly in the frontend, with no modifications made to the site's core content.

### Key Features:  
- **Customization Rules**:  
  Create detailed rules to define:  
  - **What can be edited**: Define by post types, specific pages, taxonomies, or custom fields.  
  - **Where changes apply**:  
    - For taxonomies, choose whether edits apply to **single posts** and/or **post lists**.  
    - For pages, define if **subpages inherit** editing permissions.  
  - **Who can edit**: Define by user roles, custom fields, or specific users.  
  - **What can be altered**: Editable areas defined by CSS selectors.  

- **Granular Control**:  
  For each editable area, you can specify:  
  - Which CSS properties are available for modification (e.g., colors, fonts, margins, etc.).  
  - Which images can be replaced.  

- **User-Friendly Editing Interface**:  
  - A form is displayed with the CSS property name and a field to input the value (text, select, etc.).  
  - Designed for users with basic CSS knowledge, but no manual coding is required.  

- **Security and Ease of Use**:  
  - Allows users to make changes directly on the frontend without accessing the admin panel.  

Ideal for sites that allow collaboration among multiple users but need to maintain strict control over what each user can change. With **Customize CSS**, you offer customization freedom without compromising security or the integrity of your site's layout.
